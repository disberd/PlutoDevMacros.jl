This also mean that when removing the cell with the @addmethod call, the actual method added to the DefiningModule will not be automatically erased by Pluto and will still accessible until it is not overwritten with another method with the same signature. \n\nThis is easy to fix in the case of adding methods to modules loaded with @frompackage/@fromparent as reloading the module is sufficient to remove the hanging method.\n\nSee this video for an example:\n\n(Image: Link to Video)\n\nSee also: @frompackage, @fromparent\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"other_functions/#PlutoDevMacros.@only_in_nb","page":"Other Exports","title":"PlutoDevMacros.@only_in_nb","text":"only_in_nb(ex)\n\nExecutes the expression ex only if the macro is called from a running Pluto instance and ran directly from the source notebook file.\n\nThis is more strict than PlutoHooks.@skip_as_script as including a notebook with @skip_as_script ex from another notebook would still execute ex.\n@only_in_nb ex instead only evaluates ex if the calling notebook is the original source notebook file.\n\nSee also: @only_out_nb.

The output of this function contains a script which will hide the specific log that contains it, and if no other logs are present, will also hide the log container in Pluto.\n\nThe function also optionally accept some content that will be inserted just before the script for hiding the log. The custom input can be provided as an AbstractString, or directly as an HTML object of type Docs.HTML, in which case it will simply extract the HTML contents as String from the contents field. The provided content will be directly interpreted as HTML, meaning that any script will have to be surrounded by <script> tags.\n\nThis function is used inside PlutoDevMacros to create the reload @fromparent button also via logs for redundancy.\n\nExample\n\nSuppose you are inside a Pluto notebook and you want to execute some custom javascript from a cell, but for some reason you don't want to have the javascript to be the final output of your cell. You can exploit logs for this (assuming you didn't disable logging for the cell in question).\n\nThe following snippet can be inserted in a cell to send a custom message on the javascript developer console while still having a non-javascript cell output.\n\njulia_output = let\n    @info PlutoDevMacros.hide_this_log(html\"<script>console.log('message')</script>\")\n    3\nend\n\nWhich will correctly send the message to the console even if the cell output is not the javascript script: (Image: hide_this_log example gif)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/#Package-Extensions","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"The @frompackage macro supports package extensions defined within the packages loaded by the macro within the import_block","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"We specify two possible types of extensions within the context of @frompackage:","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"Direct Extensions: These are extensions that are defined directly within the local target package loaded by the macro\nIndirect Extensions: These are extensions that are not defined by the target package directly, but by one of its dependencies.","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/#Direct-Extensions","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Direct Extensions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"An example of a scenario with Direct Extensions is the one of the TestDirectExtension package found in the test/TestDirectExtension folder and whose Project.toml is replicated below:","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"name = \"TestDirectExtension\"\nuuid = \"f446dfe5-66ce-4684-9abf-53561df9f9a0\"\nauthors = [\"Alberto Mengali <disberd@gmail.com>\"]\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\n[deps]\nRevise = \"295af30f-e4ad-537b-8983-00126c2a3abe\"\n\n[weakdeps]\nPlutoPlotly = \"8e989ff0-3d88-8e9f-f020-2b208a939ff0\"\nExample = \"7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a\"\n\n[extensions]\nPlutoPlotlyExt = \"PlutoPlotly\"\nMagic = \"Example\"","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"We can see that this package defines two extensions PlutoPlotlyExt and Magic that depend on the PlutoPlotly and Example packages respectively.","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"When the TestDirectExtension module is loaded within a Pluto notebook using the @frompackage or @fromparent macro, the module is not associated to a package UUID so julia does not know that the Magic extension has to be loaded whenever the Example package is loaded into the notebook.","category":"page"},{"location":"frompackage/package_extensions/","page":"Package Extensions","title":"Package Extensions","text":"To still support loading the extension code in this situation, the macro will eval the Magic module definition within the TestDirectExtension module if the Example package is defined within the notebook environment.
